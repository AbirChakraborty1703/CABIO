**1. Project Overview**
   
**Project Title: **

**Cabio – Real-Time Ride Management and User Dashboard System **

**Background & Problem Statement: **

Modern urban commuting requires real-time interaction between users and ride 
providers. Existing systems often lack smooth real-time coordination, robust 
dashboards, and social integration features. SkillX aims to fill this gap with a dynamic 
backend using WebSockets, user dashboards, and interactive maps.

**Objective: **

To develop a scalable platform that allows users to register, request rides, and interact 
in real time with captains (drivers), supported by an interactive dashboard and 
efficient backend. 
Goals:
 
⚫ Enable user registration, login, and profile management.

⚫ Implement real-time ride coordination using Socket.IO. 

⚫ Provide a map-based ride interface.

⚫ Create a responsive social dashboard for users. 

Scope & Deliverables: 

⚫ Full-stack ride management application 

⚫ Real-time Socket.IO backend 

⚫ REST APIs for users, captains, and ride data 

⚫ Interactive frontend dashboard (if present) 

⚫ Database schema and test coverage 

Team & Roles: 

⚫ Backend Developer: API & socket communication 

⚫ Frontend Developer: Dashboard and onboarding 

⚫ Database Architect: Schema design 

⚫ Tester: Test cases and reports 

 
 
**3. Software Requirements Specification (SRS) **

Introduction & Purpose: 

This SRS defines the requirements for the SkillX project—a web platform for user 
and ride management with real-time features. 

**System Overview: **

A Node.js backend with RESTful routes and socket-based communication powers the 
ride logic. Users and captains interact with the server, while the frontend (if present) 
provides the interface. 
User Characteristics: 

⚫ Users (riders) familiar with web apps 

⚫ Captains (drivers) managing rides 

⚫ Admins (optional) 

**Functional Requirements: **

⚫ User signup/login/logout 

⚫ View/update profiles 

⚫ Request or accept rides 

⚫ Real-time ride status updates 

Non-Functional Requirements: 

⚫ Real-time updates (WebSocket) 

⚫ High availability 

⚫ Mobile-responsive interface 

⚫ Secure authentication (JWT)

Constraints & Assumptions: 

⚫ Internet access is required 

⚫ MongoDB is the assumed database 

⚫ Real-time services depend on stable WebSocket connections
